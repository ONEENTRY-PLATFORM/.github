OneEntry combines Headless CMS and Headless E‑Commerce into a single BaaS platform, providing a unified backend designed for scalability and seamless management of both content and commerce. The core concept of the platform is to free developers from server setup, ensure secure data storage, and deliver extensible business logic without plugins or external workarounds.

## How It Works

The architecture delivers data via API and renders it using any frontend technology: websites, mobile apps, social network mini‑apps, Smart TV, and more. OneEntry includes a ready‑made cloud infrastructure, eliminating the need for DevOps involvement and letting teams focus on product development.

To make development easier, we provide SDKs for **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Kotlin**, and **Swift**.  
These SDKs include full in‑code documentation, strict type definitions, and extensive usage guides with examples — enabling fast and frictionless integration of OneEntry into projects of any complexity.

# Key Features

## Backend as a Service

A ready‑to‑use backend including business logic, database, APIs, microservices, and low‑code tools for integrating third‑party systems directly in the interface. Projects can launch without setting up servers or databases manually.

## Headless CMS

Content is managed independently from its presentation layer. The system supports text, media, files, user data, catalogs, content versioning, and multilingual support.

You can create and edit flexible data models directly in the interface, with configurable validation rules.
